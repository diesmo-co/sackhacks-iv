# sudocore

A submission for SackHacks IV.

Sudocore is a dashboard that aggregates all the information for your IoT devices and generates meaningful visuals based on them. It supports devices from all over a building, found in different rooms, where the individual devices in a room can be updated.

To run the project, 
1. clone it and `cd` into `sudocore`
2. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` at the root level
3. `cd` into `flask_main` and run `python ./main.py`. A local dev server will start.
